## The Journey Behind the Tech

I was skiing last winter when I got the idea for this app. As an intermediate skier who grew up skiing about 10 days a year, I never dressed right. It was either freezing cold out and I was freezing, or somehow it was not cold enough and I ended up really hot. If you have ever skiied before, reflect on this thought and think if you can relate or not. If you havent skiied before, take it from me, its impossible to dress right for the weather. 20 degrees and 30 degrees sound like the same type of cold when you grow up with most days being 60's and 70's. But 20 degrees and 30 degrees are very different types of cold.

Chat gpt alone knows the weather and can reason about good outfits to wear. 
Journal entries is the perfect context for ai to reason about what outfit recomendations. 

I beleive connecting them would yeild accurate recomendations for what to wear for a day of skiing.

That is when I thought of creating layers. An app aimed at doing exactly this.


## The AI + Software Integration Experiment

In building Layers, my main focus was exploring how AI can integrate with traditional software. Weâ€™re in a transitional periodâ€”software is no longer just static interfaces, and AI is beginning to reshape how people interact with applications.

### Why This Matters

The big question is: **how will AI transform software?**

* Will it replace traditional interfaces entirely?
* Or will the future be a thoughtful integration of both?

Layers explores this tension with a **dual-interface approach**:

* **Traditional UI â†’ Rigid** (explicitly designed interactions, predictable flows)
* **AI Interface â†’ Flexible** (natural conversation, tool-calling to extend capabilities)

Both the chat and the UI can do everything in the appâ€”they share the same backend for viewing, updating, inserting, and deleting logs/layers, as well as fetching weather, location, and recommendations.


### What I Discovered

I spent about **80% of my development time** building the traditional UI. Every button, toggle, and view had to be manually designed and coded, and **responsive design made this even more complicated**.

By contrast, the AI interfaceâ€”powered by the **Vercel AI SDKâ€™s tool-calling**â€”made feature integration far faster. This contrast led me to ask:

* Is the future interface purely conversational?
* Will we always need visual UI for complex data?
* What happens when AI can generate UI components on demand?

### The Temporal Window

Layers also highlights the unique moment weâ€™re in:

1. **AI isnâ€™t perfect at memory** â€“ logs of clothing preferences and comfort still improve recommendations.
2. **Context windows are limited** â€“ the app provides persistent wardrobe and weather context that AI alone cannot.
3. **Users still prefer visual interfaces** for certain tasks.

But this window is closing. As AI memory and context expand, apps like Layers may evolve into something even more powerfulâ€”where explicit storage and visual UI are optional rather than necessary.

### Results & Open Questions

Layers is an ongoing product I plan to continue developing. What excites me most are the open questions it raises about future AIâ€“software integration:

* Could there be a successful business built on APIs aloneâ€”or even entirely around MCP servers?
* Will AI outputs stay in **Markdown** (simple, universal), evolve into **generated objects** (structured calls), or move toward directly generating **UI code (HTML/CSS/React)** on demand?

These are the design experiments I set out to test with Layers, and theyâ€™ll continue shaping where I take the product next.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### MCP vs Tool Calling Architecture

i heard mcp is going to change the world. mcp = future of way ai interacts with services on the internet? , decided I must create an app with it. did deep research
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp
https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/
https://vercel.com/docs/mcp/deploy-mcp-servers-to-vercel

original architecture:
server: remote mcp server in cloudflare worker
client: supabase edge function calling openai api with reference to cloudflare server url

was a lot to manage.

second architecture: moved everything to nextjs api route
server: remote mcp server in nextjs api route
client: nextjs api route calling openai api with reference to cloudflare server url

benefit: all mcp logic both in the project directory (1 directory as opposed to 3)

when I added authentication to the app, I came to struggle with oath/passing user tokens/authentication with mcp server

realised I jumped the gun to using mcp technology, function calling was all i need to implement the app.

openai api function/tools vs vercel ai sdk

two most popular npm packages for ai, I understood open api is more foundational, vercel ai sdk is more abstract

tried open ai for tool calling

tried vercel ai sdk for tool calling

vercel ai sdk was increadibly easy

vercel ai sdk is amazing, super easy for tool calling, streaming, and ui components
https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction



mcp vs toolcalling
ai integration areas

begining philosophy of mpc server-> ai with tool calling
- openai api for tool calling -> vercel ai sdk
- supabase vs cloudflare vs vercel mcp server problems and solutions. finding documentation / templates, getting it to work greate with cloudflare verses vercel mcp documentation

multiselect -> smart ai
- ai should it output markdown, pull up display in dynamic area, or display inline components?
- experiemented with adding ai to sort filter area, ended up preferring keyword search with tanstack whatever

### Responsive Design: Mobile-First Learning
- responsive design: learned important lesson to start with phone and then build up to desktop. i think the app right now is not well designed for mobile, to many buttons to press
i did not think about mobile first design when i was making this app. i kept sharing this app with friends and family and they opened it up on phone which looked horrible
[add photos?]
i have made it mobile friendly. now looking at it, i think ther are to many buttons / togle areas, and I have idea to move more down to the bottom navbar to be able to remove the tabslists at the top of the wardrove section and the home weather section. if successful i will apply to web as well. if I had first created for mobile, i might have optimized for space then and come to a better solution early on

### State Management: Zustand vs Subscriptions
- disenfranchised by zustand, learning how little i understand about it. it is an npm package but is react agnostic, and you can not actually mount react hooks in zustand stores, makes it feel pretty confusing to me, to subscribe to a datatable and share that info across my app I needed two files. a hook, a zustand store, and I needed to mount the hook in another file in my app (app.tsx). If i use context, I could define the data and the subscription / fetching logic all in one file and then I would wrap the app with context in app.tsx. In total it takes an extra file to care for, which I did not like.

Also subscription issues. I do not know if this is a result of zustand or another problem with supabase subscriptions, I need to investigate further.
- zustand state mangement - we must check to see if it is causing subscription issues
- subscription issues






## What I'm Proud Of
feature rich sophisticated ui
