## The Journey Behind the Tech

begining philosophy of mpc server-> ai with tool calling
- openai api for tool calling -> vercel ai sdk
- supabase vs cloudflare vs vercel mcp server problems and solutions. finding documentation / templates, getting it to work greate with cloudflare verses vercel mcp documentation

begining idea / claim of the app:
i was skiing in mammoth

emphasis: ai vs software / ai chatbot vs tradition ui interface
- chat bot can do everything regular interface can do.
- i though carefully about the interface and where it would be appropriate to integrate ai
- experiemented with adding ai to sort filter area, ended up preferring keyword search with tanstack whatever
- decided on multiselect -> smart ai
- ai should it output markdown, pull up display in dynamic area, or display inline components?
- reflect on time spent working on chatbot ui versus traditional ui (flexibility versus rigidness)
- fun thought; how can i make a successful business only apis / will there be a successful business only mcp?

failiures/hardships
- responsive design: learned important lesson to start with phone and then build up to desktop. i think the app right now is not well designed for mobile
- zustand state mangement - we must check to see if it is causing subscription issues
- subscription issues

future:
- will chat gpt be able to do layers better / ai + database do layers better? and expanding to logging something else as well?
- basically i veiw this project as still a work in progress

working in a team with nate:
a/b testing
