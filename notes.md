**TODO:**
get rid of comfort, make selectcards editable
make add log super approachable. either somethign completely new or a what are you wearing today card as the starter.
change lat and lon to real location / make weather card able to look at other places weather... then add a history button
google lense/ image upload for app

what did you wear today?
what should i wear today?
i wore my uniqlo heat tech, my my orange pants, my patagonia shell, and i got hot by the time i finished the day.
address should flow around with lat/lon

also log should have default date and location and should be set up to get weather via trigger   <--->
chat should also insert log with a lat and lon
simplify useglobalsubscription
