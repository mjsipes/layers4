fasinating the getlocation subscriptions we can no longer mount in the weather componentn because on mobile they are not mounted

what should i wear today?
i wore my uniqlo heat tech, my my orange pants, my patagonia shell, and i got hot by the time i finished the day.

little things: blue border around chips in grid dissapeared. weather card is not perfectly set at fixed pixels. is google api key safe to expose through the browser?


when it comes to styling, what is the difference between a card and a badge? should i always try to use the shadcn classes? and then just override them?
read through the code
and logically how should i decide on my spacing and font sizes? ex (sortfilter bar versus weathercard first row)
