**TODO:**

fine tune interaction with chat bot
image upload
fine tune interaction with recomendation area

what are you wearing today?
what should i wear today?
semantic search?
get rid of comfort
clean up lat lon / real address logic. (chat tools) (google api) (read through all files)
then add a history button

we should try to create an add log card that instead of the multi select and text area, it is two text areas, first with preveiw of what are you wearing today? and the second with how did you feel? (too hot, too cold, just right) then have ai parse it and link logs

cards versus badges
